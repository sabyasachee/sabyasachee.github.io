I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Signal Analysis & Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu), working under the
advisement of [Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html), in the Computer Science Department
of the University of Southern California.

My research interests lie in __narrative understanding__ :books: and __long context modeling__.

I aim to use computational tools to study how a story is told, why some stories appeal more to us,
and aid creators to weave _better_ stories.
I have worked in coreference resolution, affective computing, and information extraction.

I am an avid fan of Premier League football :soccer: and spicy food :fire:.
