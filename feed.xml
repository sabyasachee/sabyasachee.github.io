Static attribute types such as gender and name seldom change, but dynamic attribute types such as attire, emotion, and possessions, can change frequently.</p> <p>Attribute types could also have small or large scope. Small-scope attribute types such as age and profession require a small context, usually a phrase or a single sentence, to be accurately determined. Large-scope attribute types require a larger context – several paragraphs or a full book chapter – for their resolution. The goal and personality of the character are examples of large-scope attribute-types.</p> <h2 id="question-answering-model-for-attribute-extraction">Question Answering Model for Attribute Extraction</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/attribute-extraction.svg-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/attribute-extraction.svg-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/attribute-extraction.svg-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/attribute-extraction.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The LLM-based question answering pipeline used to extract attribute frames </div> <p>The above picture shows the complete pipeline we use to extract, prompt, and evaluate the character attribute extraction task using a question answering approach.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Find characters</strong> - Given the movie scripts (story documents), we apply coreference resolution to find the characters.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Find story passages</strong> - We apply screenplay parsing to find the sluglines, action descriptions, and speech segments of the movie script. We use the short action descriptions, containing between 25 to 200 words, to find the small-scope attribute types. We use multiple contiguous action and speech segments, containing between 200 to 496 words, to find the large-scope attribute types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Find attribute types</strong> - In the absence of attribute taxonomies, we apply a data-driven approach to curate a list of attribute types. We use a <em>few-shot</em> prompt on the story passages to query which attribute types are described. We collate the responses and pick the attribute types forming the top-90% probability mass.</p> <p>We end up with 13 attribute types.</p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="300" data-virtual-scroll-item-height="5px" data-pagination="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/attributes.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="attribute" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Attribute Type</th> <th data-field="definition" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Definition</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </li> </ol> <p><br/></p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Score implicitness</strong> - Having found the characters, passages, and attribute types, we can now query a large language model (LLM) to find the attribute values. Prompting a paid LLM service such as GPT will incur very high costs because the attribute distribution is very sparse. Therefore, we first estimate the likelihood of a passage to describe some attribute of the character. We call this the implicitness score.</p> <blockquote> <p>Implicitness is a score of how hard it is to find the attribute value of a specific attribute type and character from the passage.</p> </blockquote> <p>Consider the following passages.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Julia reappears from the kitchen holding a birthday cake, 17 candles on top. 
She brings it to John. He eyes her before blowing out the candles
</code></pre></div> </div> <p>To find the age of John, the model has to infer from the sentence that he is celebrating his birthday and is seventeen years old because his birthday cake contains seventeen candles. This is a hard or <em>highly implicit</em> example.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>John is celebrating his seventeenth birthday with his mother
</code></pre></div> </div> <p>Conversely, this is a much easier example for the model to find the age of John. Therefore, it is easy or <em>less implicit</em>.</p> <p>We find a crude estimate of implicitness by querying an open-source instruction-tuned LLM – <em>Flan</em>-T5 – on whether the passage describes the specific attribute type of the character. Additionally, we instruct the LLM to answer either in “yes” or “no”.</p> <p><strong>Implicitness is 1 - the word probability of “yes” in the LLM’s response.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prompt attribute value</strong> - We sample attribute type, character, and passage tuples based on the implicitness score and the movie genre. We end up with about 50 tuples per attribute type. Next, we apply different prompting approaches on GPT-3.5 to find the attribute value of these tuples.</p> <p>a. <strong>Zero-Shot</strong> - The zero-shot prompt consists of the task instruction, attribute type definition, and the example passage.</p> <p>b. <strong>Few-Shot</strong> - The few-shot prompt adds 6-8 exemplars to demonstrate the type of responses expected from the model.</p> <p>c. <strong>Chain-of-thought</strong> - The chain-of-thought prompt is similar to the few-shot prompt, except it modifies the responses in the exemplars to include an explanation before concluding with the answer. The explanation serves to summarize the relevant section of the passage that informs about the attribute value.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-1.svg-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-1.svg-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-1.svg-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-1.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-2.svg-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-2.svg-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-2.svg-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-2.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-3.svg-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-3.svg-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-3.svg-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2023-06-24-attribute-extraction/result-3.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Performance of different prompting methods <i>(left)</i> and how it varies with the implicitness of the example <i>(middle)</i>.

Our results (middle picture) show that Chain-of-Thought’s performance overtakes Few-Shot’s as the implicitness increases.</p> <p>The analysis of errors made by different prompting methods also reveals some interesting trends. The <em>Not-Found</em> error occurs when the model is unable to find the attribute value and provides a null response even though the example describes some relevant attribute value. The <em>Different-Attribute</em> error occurs when the model finds the attribute value of some attribute type different than the queried attribute type. <strong>Error analysis shows that Chain-of-Thought prompting makes more <em>Not-Found</em> and less <em>Different-Attribute</em> errors than Few-Shot</strong>.</p> <p>These results show that Chain-of-Thought might overextend its contextual inference and infer situations not implied by the example. On average, Chain-of-Thought does not improve performance in the attribute extraction task. However, as the examples become more implicit, Chain-of-Thought prompting is more effective than Few-Shot because it allows deeper understanding of the content. The results of error analysis also show that Chain-of-Thought is stricter than Few-Shot in providing a response and is more faithful to the queried attribute type.</p> <p>To conclude, an effective prompting approach is to apply Few-Shot prompting for the less implicit examples and change to Chain-of-Thought prompting when the examples become more implicit.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="information-extraction"/><category term="question-answering"/><category term="movie-screenplays"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can LLMs find character attributes?]]></summary></entry></feed>
